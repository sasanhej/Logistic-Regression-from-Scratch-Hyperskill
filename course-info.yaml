title: Logistic Regression from Scratch
language: English
summary: "<p>In this project, we will take a look at the logistic regression algorithm\
  \ and build a custom binary classifier. The main idea of the project is to implement\
  \ gradient descent for two different cost functions, devise a method to predict\
  \ the probability that a given sample belongs to a certain class, and analyze training\
  \ errors. And last but not least â€” put your models to the test on a real dataset.</p><br/><br/>Learn\
