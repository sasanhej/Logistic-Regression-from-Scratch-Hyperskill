# Logistic-Regression-from-Scratch-Hyperskill
This is "Logistic Regression from Scratch Hyperskill" project form Hyperskill.<br>
Come to know logistic regression. Learn the math behind it and implement a solution that will be on par with the one from sklearn. Study two kinds of cost function — Mean Squared Error and Log Loss. These concepts will give you the freedom to combine different tools for solving complex problems.<br>
In this project, we will take a look at the logistic regression algorithm and build a custom binary classifier. The main idea of the project is to implement gradient descent for two different cost functions, devise a method to predict the probability that a given sample belongs to a certain class, and analyze training errors. And last but not least — put your models to the test on a real dataset.<br>
Note: This repository contains all files from Hyperskill for evaluating each step of the project and quizes and etc.<br>
